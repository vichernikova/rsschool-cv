## About Me ##

I'm just getting started as a front-end developer. I love to solve business problems by fusing creativity, innovation and effective communication.

const multiply = (...numbers) => numbers.reduce((total, number) => total * number);

  return name.split(" ").map(el => el[0].toUpperCase()).join(".")
}
 ```
